# Arboviruses Analysis – Recife 2024
Project developed for the Data Analyst course by EBAC in partnership with SEMANTIX

## About the Project
This project was created as part of the final challenge of the EBAC Data Analyst Professional course, in collaboration with Semantix. The goal was to identify a real-world issue that could be addressed through data analysis and develop a complete end-to-end solution.

## Objective
To analyze the occurrence of urban arboviruses (mainly dengue, zika, and chikungunya) in the city of Recife during the year 2024, using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify:

The demographic profile of the most affected populations

Seasonal trends and geographical distribution

Mortality and demographic impacts

Data visualizations to support public health decision-making

## Why This Topic?
Arboviruses transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito remain a significant public health issue in Brazil, especially in urban centers like Recife. With recurring outbreaks and health system impacts, data-driven strategies are essential to:

Understand the dynamics of disease spread

Support awareness campaigns

Optimize resource allocation for prevention and treatment

## Technologies and Tools
Python

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Jupyter Notebook

Public Health Datasets (Recife, 2024)
